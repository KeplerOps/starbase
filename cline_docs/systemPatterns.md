# Starbase: System Patterns

## Core Architectural Patterns

### 1. Query Translation Architecture

The fundamental architectural pattern of Starbase is the "Query Translation" approach:

- **Store Native, Translate Queries**: Logs are stored in their original format, and queries are translated to match each format.
- **Meta-Model Mapping**: A universal meta-model defines semantic relationships between fields across different log formats.
- **One-Time Mapping Cost**: Mappings between formats are created once per format, not per log entry.
- **Format-Aware Processing**: The system is aware of the format of each log and processes it accordingly.

This pattern inverts the traditional ETL approach used by most logging systems, dramatically reducing compute costs and preserving data fidelity.

### 2. Tiered Storage Architecture

Starbase employs a tiered storage approach to balance performance and cost:

- **Hot Storage**: Recent, frequently accessed logs in high-performance storage.
- **Warm Storage**: Older logs in cost-effective storage with reasonable query performance.
- **Cold Storage**: Archival logs in very low-cost storage with query capability.
- **Automatic Tiering**: Logs move between tiers based on age and access patterns.

This pattern enables cost-effective storage of massive log volumes while maintaining query performance for active data.

### 3. Federated Query Engine

The query engine operates across multiple storage formats and locations:

- **Query Planning**: Decompose queries into format-specific sub-queries.
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute sub-queries in parallel across different data stores.
- **Result Unification**: Combine and normalize results from different sources.
- **Query Optimization**: Rewrite queries for optimal performance on each backend.

This pattern allows unified querying across diverse log sources without data centralization.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Schema Approach: Meta-Model with Native Storage

- **Decision**: Use a meta-model for query and analysis while preserving native log formats in storage.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Transform all logs to a common format (rejected due to compute cost and data loss)
  - Use schema-less approach (rejected due to query complexity)
- **Rationale**: Provides unified analysis capability without the cost of transforming every log.
- **Implications**: Requires sophisticated query translation but dramatically reduces processing costs.

### 2. AI Integration: Hybrid Learning Approach

- **Decision**: Use a hybrid approach combining pre-trained models, rule generation, and continuous learning.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Pure machine learning (rejected due to training data requirements)
  - Pure rule-based (rejected due to maintenance complexity)
- **Rationale**: Balances automation with reliability and continuous improvement.
- **Implications**: Requires infrastructure for model training and evaluation.

### 3. Storage Format: Format-Native with Metadata

- **Decision**: Store logs in their native format with added metadata for efficient retrieval.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Columnar conversion (rejected due to transformation cost)
  - Pure object storage (rejected due to query performance)
- **Rationale**: Preserves all original information while enabling efficient querying.
- **Implications**: Requires format-aware storage and retrieval mechanisms.

### 4. Deployment Model: Flexible Deployment Options

- **Decision**: Support multiple deployment models including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid approaches.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Cloud-only (rejected due to vendor lock-in)
  - Traditional installation (rejected due to operational complexity)
- **Rationale**: Balances ease of deployment with flexibility.
- **Implications**: Requires environment-agnostic core with optional environment-specific optimizations.

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Component Architecture

Starbase is built as a set of loosely coupled components:

- **Ingestion Service**: Receives logs from various sources.
- **Storage Service**: Manages log storage across tiers.
- **Query Service**: Processes and executes queries.
- **AI Service**: Provides log understanding capabilities.
- **API Gateway**: Provides unified access to all services.
- **Web UI**: Provides user interface for interaction.

Each component can scale independently based on load.

### 2. Data Flow Patterns

The primary data flows in the system are:

- **Ingestion Flow**: Source → Validation → Minimal Processing → Storage
- **Query Flow**: Query → Translation → Execution → Result Normalization → Presentation
- **Learning Flow**: Sample Selection → Feature Extraction → Model Training → Deployment

These flows are designed to minimize processing at ingestion time and defer heavy computation to query time.

### 3. Ingestion Protocol

The ingestion protocol follows these key patterns:

- **Format-Specific Endpoints**: Each log format has its own dedicated ingestion endpoint.
- **Index-Based Architecture**: One index per log format for optimized processing.
- **HTTP First**: Initial implementation uses HTTP for simplicity and compatibility.
- **Protocol Extensibility**: Architecture designed to support additional protocols as needed.
- **Batched Ingestion**: Support for submitting multiple logs in a single request.
- **Zero-Copy Processing**: Where possible, logs are processed without unnecessary copying.

This approach balances simplicity with performance while maintaining a clear path for future optimization.

### 4. Extension Patterns

Starbase is designed for extensibility through:

- **Plugin Architecture**: For adding support for new log formats, storage backends, etc.
- **API-First Design**: All functionality available through APIs.
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Publish events for external system integration.
- **Custom Processing Hooks**: Allow custom processing at various stages.

This enables community contributions and integration with existing tools.

## Performance Patterns

### 1. Query Optimization

- **Format-Specific Optimization**: Translate queries to optimal form for each backend.
- **Query Planning**: Determine most efficient execution strategy.
- **Caching**: Cache query results and translations.
- **Partial Materialization**: Pre-compute common query patterns.

### 2. Ingestion Optimization

- **Batching**: Process logs in batches for efficiency.
- **Minimal Processing**: Perform only essential processing at ingestion.
- **Async Processing**: Decouple reception from processing.
- **Backpressure Handling**: Gracefully handle ingestion spikes.

### 3. Storage Optimization

- **Compression**: Use format-appropriate compression.
- **Partitioning**: Partition data for query efficiency.
- **Indexing**: Create minimal indexes for common queries.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically manage data across storage tiers.

These patterns ensure Starbase can handle high volumes of logs with minimal resource usage.

## Documentation Patterns

### 1. Documentation Principles

- **No Timeline Estimates**: NEVER include date/timeline estimates in documentation. They create false expectations and are invariably inaccurate.
- **Feature-Based Planning**: Organize work by features and capabilities, not by time periods.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track progress by completion status (not started, in progress, completed) rather than by dates.
- **Iterative Approach**: Document the iterative nature of development without committing to specific timeframes.

### 2. Documentation Structure

- **Living Documents**: All documentation is treated as living and continuously updated.
- **Clear Ownership**: Each document has clear ownership and update responsibilities.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent formatting and structure across all documentation.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Maintain clear references between related documents.

### 3. Documentation Types

- **Architecture Documents**: Describe the system design and patterns.
- **Component Specifications**: Detail individual component behavior and interfaces.
- **Development Guides**: Provide guidance for developers working on the system.
- **Operational Documentation**: Describe deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.
