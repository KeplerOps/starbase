# Starbase: Progress Status

## Project Status Overview

Starbase is in the initial architecture and design phase. We have established the core concepts and architectural approach but have not yet begun implementation.

### Current Status: Planning Phase

- ‚úÖ Core concept defined: Query translation instead of data transformation
- ‚úÖ Key architectural patterns established
- ‚úÖ Technical requirements identified
- ‚úÖ Initial documentation created
- ‚è≥ Detailed component design in progress
- üîú Implementation not yet started

## What Works

As the project is in the planning phase, no components have been implemented yet. However, we have:

1. **Conceptual Validation**

   - Identified existing technologies that can be leveraged

2. **Documentation**
   - Product context and vision
   - System architecture patterns
   - Technical context and constraints

3. **Research**
