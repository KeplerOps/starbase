## Recent Changes

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Query Translation Approach**
   - Decided to use query translation instead of data transformation
   - Established that logs will be stored in their native format
   - Determined that queries will be translated to match each format
   - Confirmed the economic advantage of this approach

2. **Meta-Model Concept**
   - Defined the need for a universal meta-model
   - Established that mappings will be created once per format
   - Decided to use a hybrid approach combining ECS, OTel, and OCSF concepts
   - Determined that the meta-model will be extensible

3. **Storage Strategy**
   - Selected a tiered storage approach
   - Decided to use object storage for raw log data
   - Established the need for metadata indexing
   - Determined that format-specific optimizations will be used

4. **Ingestion Protocol**
   - Selected HTTP as the initial ingestion protocol for simplicity and compatibility
   - Decided on an index-based architecture with one format per index
   - Established that each log format will have its own dedicated endpoint
   - Designed for protocol extensibility to support higher throughput options in the future

### Research Findings

1. **Existing Systems Analysis**
   - Analyzed limitations of traditional log management systems
   - Identified that no existing system fully implements our approach
   - Found partial implementations in data virtualization tools
   - Discovered schema-on-read approaches in data lake technologies

2. **Format Evaluation**
   - Evaluated ECS, OTel, CloudWatch, and OCSF formats
   - Identified commonalities and differences
   - Assessed mapping complexity
   - Determined initial format support priorities

3. **AI Technique Research**
   - Researched NLP approaches for log understanding
   - Evaluated transformer models for field extraction
   - Investigated active learning for continuous improvement
   - Assessed hybrid approaches combining rules and ML

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Meta-Model Definition**
   - Define the core fields and concepts
   - Create initial mappings for CloudWatch and OpenTelemetry (OTel)
   - Document the mapping approach
   - Validate with sample logs

2. **Component Interface Design**
   - Define interfaces between major components
   - Establish API contracts
   - Document data formats
   - Create sequence diagrams for key operations

3. **Proof of Concept Planning**
   - Define scope of initial proof of concept
   - Identify minimum viable functionality
   - Select test datasets
   - Establish success criteria

### Short-Term Goals

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Create Docker Compose configuration
   - Set up local development tools
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline
   - Create development documentation

2. **Initial Implementation**
   - Implement basic meta-model
   - Create simple query translator
   - Develop minimal storage adapter
   - Build basic ingestion pipeline

3. **Testing Framework**

   - Open source licensing approach
   - Community engagement strategy

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Development resource requirements
   - Infrastructure cost estimates
   - Training data acquisition approach
   - External dependencies and partnerships

## Current Blockers

1. **Technical Blockers**
   - Need to validate query translation performance
   - Require sample datasets for diverse log formats
   - Need to assess AI model training requirements
   - Must validate storage performance assumptions

2. **Resource Blockers**
   - Development environment setup
   - Access to testing resources
   - Training data for AI models
   - Documentation tools and processes

## Recent Discussions

1. **Query Translation Approach**
   - Discussed the economic advantage of translating queries instead of transforming logs
   - Explored existing implementations in other domains
   - Considered technical challenges and solutions
   - Validated the approach against alternative strategies

2. **Meta-Model Design**
   - Explored different schema approaches (ECS, OTel, OCSF)
   - Discussed hybrid approach combining strengths of each
   - Considered extensibility and evolution
   - Evaluated mapping complexity

3. **AI Integration Strategy**
   - Discussed hybrid approach combining rules and ML
   - Explored training data requirements
   - Considered continuous learning approach
   - Evaluated performance and accuracy tradeoffs

4. **Initial Format Support**
   - Decided to focus on CloudWatch logs and OpenTelemetry (OTel) logs as our initial supported formats
   - Selected these formats because they are well-defined, structured, and have clear specifications
   - Confirmed that each format would have its own dedicated index
   - Established that additional formats could be added incrementally as needed

This active context will be updated regularly as the project progresses to reflect current focus, recent changes, and upcoming priorities.
