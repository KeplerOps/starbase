# Starbase Cursor Rules

## Core Development Principles

1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - Always prefer the simplest solution that works.
2. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - Don't build features until you actually need them.
3. Get basic things working first - Start with minimal implementations, then iterate.
4. NEVER include timeline estimates in any documentation.

## Code Style

1. Prioritize readability over cleverness.
2. Use modern idioms but avoid unnecessary complexity.
3. Optimize for performance in the critical path only.
4. Document public interfaces thoroughly.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Focus on the log emitter and router components first.
2. Use Docker for local development and testing.
3. Implement the simplest version that works before adding features.
4. Write tests for critical functionality.

## Documentation Rules

1. Keep documentation concise and to the point.
2. Focus on what and how, not when.
3. Document interfaces and configuration options.
4. Use examples for clarity.

## Commit Guidelines

1. Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
2. Keep commits focused on a single change.
3. Include relevant test updates with feature changes.
4. Reference issues where applicable.
