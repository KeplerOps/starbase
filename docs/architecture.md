# Starbase Architecture

## Overview

Starbase is an open-source logging platform designed to revolutionize log management through a novel "query translation" approach rather than the traditional "data transformation" approach. This document outlines the high-level conceptual architecture of the system without committing to specific technologies.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Store Native, Translate Queries**: Store logs in their original format and translate queries to match each format.
2. **Minimize Ingestion Processing**: Perform minimal processing at ingestion time to reduce compute costs.
3. **Decouple Components**: Build loosely coupled components that can scale independently.
4. **AI-Powered Understanding**: Use machine learning to automate log understanding and mapping.
5. **Cost Optimization**: Design for economic efficiency at scale.
